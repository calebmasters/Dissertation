This is a repository for some of my work for my Dissertation project.
It is not an exhaustive account of all files that I used for analysis - but it contains key files used for statistical analysis alongside a complete dataset.
If any furhter files are required for the marking process please contact me at calebmasters101@gmail.com

Understanding the dataset:
    The dataset can be found as `dataanlysis.csv` - it does not include any actual speech quotes. 
    The dataset can be understood where each line is a speech, and the `theme_combined` column represents the themes detected in the speech.
    The themes are represented by acronymns that are as follows:
    `AG` - Green-Growth Critical
    `NG` - No Growth Speech Detected in the speech
    `S_Int` - Strong International Growth sentiment
    `S_Dom` - Strong Domestic Growth Sentiment
    `S_Reg` - Strong Regional Growth Sentiment
    `W_Int` - Weak International Growth sentiment
    `W_Dom` - Weak Domestic Growth sentiment
    `W_Reg` - Weak Regional Growth sentiment
    HDI, CO2 per capita & GDP per capita data can be found in the `HDI`, `GDP_Capita` & `Annual_Capita_CO2_Consumption` folders respecively.
    There is data on if the speech was translated in the `Language` column, the country whose speech it is repressenting in the `Country Name` column.
    The `Event` column dictates what COP event the speech was detected in.
